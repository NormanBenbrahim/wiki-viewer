# Wikipedia Viewer App

This is the repo containing code for my wikipedia viewer. This makes use of wikipedia's API to pull a random article on the click of a button, or search for any topic using Wikipedia's search engine and display them on the webpage. The app will be hosted on codepen [here](https://codepen.io/elefun/pen/oxGrgx)
